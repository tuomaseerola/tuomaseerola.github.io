I have released various datasets, tools and computational packages. Here are the latest R packages. 

## Code

* [MusicScienceData](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/MusicScienceData) is an _R package_ that offers example datasets suitable for exploration of basic analyses (correlation, comparison of means, etc.) in music and science studies. It is used in [Music and Science](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/book/) textbook.
* [onsetsync](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/onsetsync/) is a _R package_ for musical assessing synchrony between onsets from multiple music performers. It works with OSF deposited data, annotated onsets, annotation structures, and contains a host of utility functions of synchrony analyses.
* [movementsync](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/movementsync/) is a _R package_ that provides analysis and visualisation of synchrony, interaction, and joint movements from audio and video movement data of a group of music performers ([CRAN release](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/movementsync/index.html)).
* [inconMore](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/inconMore) is an R package that supplements simultaneous consonance perception datasets originally provided by Peter Harrison’s excellent [incon](https://github.com/pmcharrison/incon) library.
* [CVI](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/CVI) is an R package that offers various _Content Validity Index_ calculations for scale development. This is currently being used in our work implementing measurement models for a [new music and emotion theory](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03057356241279763).
* [emr](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/emr/) contains a set of notebooks associated with a book titled [Music and Science – A Guide to Empirical Research](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/book/) (Routledge 2024) that span R (for statistics) and Python for music analysis from symbolic and audio domains.
* [MIDI toolbox](https://github.com/miditoolbox/) is now pretty old Matlab toolbox for analysing MIDI files (it was released in 2003).

## Data

I attempt to release all data of papers I write and I keep track of these in a GitHub repository [OpenData](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata/)
