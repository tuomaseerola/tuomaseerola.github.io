I have released various datasets, tools and computational packages. Here are the latest R packages. 

* [MusicScienceData](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/MusicScienceData) is an R package that offers example datasets suitable for exploration of basic analyses (correlation, comparison of means, etc.) in music and science studies

* [onsetsync](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/onsetsync/) is a R package for musical assessing synchrony between onsets from multiple music performers

* [movementsync](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/movementsync/) provides analysis and visualisation of synchrony, interaction, and joint movements from audio and video movement data of a group of music performers (CRAN release)

* [inconMore](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/inconMore) is an R library that supplements simultaneous consonance perception datasets originally provided by Peter Harrison’s wonderful [incon](https://github.com/pmcharrison/incon) library

* [emr](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/emr) is a set of jupyter notebooks containing code associated with a book titled "Music and Science – Guide to Empirical Music Research" (Routledge 2024)

I attempt to release all data of papers I write and I keep track of these in GitHub repository [OpenData](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata/)
