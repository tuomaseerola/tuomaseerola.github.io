I am music scholar working in the field of empirical musicology, music psychology and music and science. My topics of interest are music and emotions and how we perceive music, especially the central elements such as melody, timbre, rhythm, metre and dissonance, read more of my [research](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/).

My institutional homepage can be found at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/tuomas-eerola/), and I am co-director of [Music and Science Lab](https://musicscience.net/), and here is a dynamic database of my [publications](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/publications). My [Academic CV](tuomaseerola_CV.pdf) is also available here.

I mainly work with empirical data and my aim is to carry out research as _transparently_ as possible, which includes commitment to:

* releasing my research as open data and code, [see coverage here]](http://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata/)
* formalising my research with computational models, [more here](_posts/2021-10-17-topic.md)
* publishing all research as Open Access, [see here](publications.md)
* contributing to research transparency initiatives and training
