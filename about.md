I am music scholar working in the field of empirical musicology, music psychology and music and science. My topics of interest are music and emotions and how we perceive music, especially the central elements such as melody, timbre, rhythm, metre and dissonance.

My institutional homepage can be found at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/tuomas-eerola/), and I am co-director of [Music and Science Lab](https://musicscience.net/), and here is a dynamic database of my [publications](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/publications). My [Academic CV](tuomaseerola_CV.pdf) is also available here.

### Music and emotions

Music affects our emotions in rapid, unique and profound ways. To understand this topic better, we have explored three broad questions:

1. What are the emotional experiences listeners have with music, and how these can be reliably captured, and how we should attempt to explain these theoretically and empirically?

2. How do specific emotional experiences such as sadness or chills related to music operate? [Why some people really derive deep enjoyment of sad music](https://musicscience.net/projects/music-emotions/sad-music/)? Or why some pieces of music seem to give goosebumps and chills to some listeners but not to others?

3. [What features of music communicate emotional expression in Western music?](https://musicscience.net/projects/music-emotions/music-properties/) How similar are the features linked to emotional expression in different musical genres and [cultures](https://musicscience.net/cross-cultural-research-in-music-and-emotions/)?

### [Computational models of music perception](_posts/2021-10-17-topic.md)

The second fundamental question about music is how do we parse this complex auditory cocktail together? How do we extract melody, rhythm, phrasing, dynamics, harmonic elements and timbre from the complex sound signals? These topics can be best understood by formulating the ideas as computational models which are tested with empirical data.

1. What does our mind expect when we hear a snippet of melody? 

2. [How do we synchronise with the beat and coordinate our behaviour in ensemble performance?](https://musicscience.net/projects/timing/iemp/) 

3. Why and how some harmonies are rich and appealing but some are jarring and consonant? How does texture and colour of sounds communicate expression in music?

### Research principles

I mainly work with empirical data and my aim is to carry out research as _transparently_ as possible, which includes commitment to
* [open data and code](http://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata/)
* formalising research with computational models [more here](_posts/2021-10-17-topic.md)
* open access publications [link](publications.md)
