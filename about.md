I am music scholar working on the fields of empirical musicology, music psychology and music and science. My topics of interest are music and emotions, perception of the key elements of music such as melody, timbre, rhythm, metre and dissonance.

My institutional homepage can be found at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/tuomas-eerola/), and I am co-director of [Music and Science Lab](https://musicscience.net/), and you can scroll through my publications at [/publications/](publications) or [https://tuomaseerola.github.io/publications/](publications).

## Research Themes

I have worked on a number of different research themes and topics. Here are some example questions from these topics.

### Music and emotions

How music affects our emotions? What are the actual emotions, can they be reliable captured with self-reports and psychophysiology? Why some pieces of music seem to give goosebumps and chills to some listeners but not to others? [What features of music communicate emotional expression in Western music](https://musicscience.net/projects/music-emotions/music-properties/)? How similar are the features linked to emotional expression in different musical genres and [cultures](https://musicscience.net/cross-cultural-research-in-music-and-emotions/)? [Why some people really derive deep enjoyment of sad music](https://musicscience.net/projects/music-emotions/sad-music/)? I also collaborate with scholars who explore whether [music is particularly strong in creating autobiographical memories](https://musicscience.net/projects/music-memory/meams/).

### [Computational modells of music perception](_posts/2021-10-17-topic.md)

How do we parse together meaningful elements such as melody, rhythm, timbre from the complex sound signal? What does our mind expect when we hear a snippet of melody or [how do we synchronise with the beat and coordinate our behaviour in ensemble performance?](https://musicscience.net/projects/timing/iemp/) Why and how some harmonies are rich and appealing but some are jarring and consonant? How does texture and colour of sounds communicate expression in music?

### Research principles

I try to work with empirical data and operate in transparent fashion. This includes commitment to
* [open data and code](http://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata/)
* formalising research with computational models
* open access publications
