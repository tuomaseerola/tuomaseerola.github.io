I am music scholar working in the field of empirical musicology, music psychology and music and science. I utilise empirical experiments, theorising, and computational models to study how people engage with and process music. My work encompasses a wide range of topics, including emotions induced by music and perception of musical structure, rhythm, timbre, consonance, and emotional communication through music. I have published more than 160 papers and book chapters, and here is a dynamic database of my <A HREF="https://tuomaseerola.github.io/publications/">publications</A>. and I'm on editorial boards of several prominent music psychology journals and my research has been funded by the Academy of Finland, AHRC (UK), ESRC (UK), and EU Horizon 2020.

My institutional homepage can be found at <A HREF="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/tuomas-eerola/">Durham University</A>  and I am co-director of <A HREF="https://musicscience.net/">Music and Science Lab</A>. I have served in a number of leadership positions such as Head of Department, Director of Research, and Director of Postgraduate Studies. My <A HREF="https://tuomaseerola.github.io/tuomaseerola_CV.pdf">Academic CV</A> is also available here.
