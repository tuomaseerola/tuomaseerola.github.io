I am music scholar working in the field of empirical musicology, music psychology and music and science. I utilise empirical experiments, theorising, and computational models to study how people engage with and process music. My work encompasses a wide range of topics, including emotions induced by music and perception of musical structure, rhythm, timbre, consonance, and emotional communication through music. Here is a dynamic database of my <A HREF="https://tuomaseerola.github.io/publications/">publications</A>. I'm on editorial boards of several prominent music psychology journals and my research has been funded by the Academy of Finland, AHRC (UK), ESRC (UK), and EU Horizon 2020.
