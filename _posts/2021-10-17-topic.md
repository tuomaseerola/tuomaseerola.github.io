Computational music research is a field that combines psychology, music theory, and computer science to study various aspects of music, such as perception, and cognition of music. 

Computational models can help us to express our ideas about musical processes in a precise way that offers precise ways to test and explore these ideas. I have explored how we perceive melodies, especially melodic expectations, timbre, emotions expressed by music, consonance and dissonance, and rhythm and entrainment.
