Computational music research is a field that combines psychology, music theory, and computer science to study various aspects of music, such as perception and cognition of music. In this short blog I talk about the way I have used models to test ideas, theories and concepts in music perception

Computational models can help us to express our ideas about musical processes in a precise way that offers precise ways to test and explore these ideas. I have explored how we perceive melodies, especially melodic expectations ([Eerola et al., 2009](http://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1177/102986490901300203)), emotions expressed by music ([Saari et al., 2015](http://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2462841)), perception of consonance and dissonance ([Eerola & Lahdelma, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1177/2059204321103047)), and rhythm and entrainment ([Eerola et a., 2018](http://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171520)) with computational models.

One fascinating aspect of computational models is to apply them to a collection of music to discover the typical structures such as metric patterns ([Toiviainen & Eerola, 2006](http://doi.org/10.1121/1.2146084)) or to find out how melodies have evolved across the time of their use ([Street et al., 2022](http://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01139-y)).

I have released a number of computational tools and models to facilitate the computational analysis of music. 

* MIDI toolbox ([Eerola & Toiviainen, 2003](https://github.com/miditoolbox/))
* MIR toolbox ([Lartillot et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78246-9_31))
* Computational models of simultaneous consonance ([Eerola, 2021](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/inconMore))
* Onset synchrony calculation ([Eerola & Clayton, 2024](https://tuomaseerola.github.io/onsetsync/articles/onsetsync.html))

You can find most of the data that I have published over the last 5 years openly available, see [https://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/opendata).
