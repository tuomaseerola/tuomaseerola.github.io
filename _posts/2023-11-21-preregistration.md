We are proud to announce the publication of the first Registered Reported in Music Perception with our paper titled [Valenced Priming with Acquired Affective Concepts in Music: Automatic Reactions to Common Tonal Chords](https://online.ucpress.edu/mp).

A **Registered Report** is a special type of publication format that takes the open science requirements to the maximum level; a detailed research plan is subjected to peer review before any data is collected. The purpose is to ensure that the methods, hypotheses, and analysis steps are defined to avoid any cherry-picking, p-hacking, and revision of the hypothesis after the results are known. In short, the purpose is to promote transparency of research and also allow publishing results no matter what the outcome is and thus also avoiding the bias of publishing only positive findings. 

In our case, we wrote every part of the research plan down and publicly preregistered them on [OSF](https://osf.io/x8yvk). The idea was to use an objective way of measuring the impact of sounds through the affective priming paradigm, and pit sounds that can be associated with either positive or negative affects against positive or negative words. If the sound and word are _congruent_ (say a minor chord and word such as "morgue"), a participant will quickly be able to classify the word "morgue" as negative. If the sound is positive (say a major chord) but a word is negative, this incongruence between sound and word is visible in the slower decision making process, indexed with reaction time. This method is not impacted by conscious thinking and has provided solid results in psychology since the 1970s. We have applied it to intervals and chords and shown that consonance and dissonance via acoustic roughness is able to bring measurable differences through affective priming ([Armitage et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0005623), [Lahdelma et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/10298649209111)).

In the past, roughness contrasts (e.g., dissonant m2 vs consonant P5 intervals) have always driven the responses of affective priming studies. In the present study, we examined what happens when chords that cannot be distinguished by roughness but still have strong cultural connotations that make them opposite in character are placed in an affective priming paradigm.. For instance, the diminished chord is a well-known symbol of something sinister in Western music, whereas the major chord is regarded as positive, although these two chords are not substantially different in their roughness. We pitted 4 pairs of such chords (Major-Minor, Major-Augmented, Major-Diminished, and Major-Suspended 4) against each other in four experiments and predicted the outcome for the affective priming based on past findings. This suggested that the first three pairs should be distinguished in the affective priming paradigm but we have no reason to believe that the Major-Suspended 4 pair produces different responses as Sus 4 is not really a negative sign in Western culture despite its dissonance).

This plan was submitted to peer review in Music Perception (link). After receiving the feedback, we addressed the points raised by three expert reviewers to the plan, and then after getting the approval for our changes, we finally collected (N=400) and analysed the data according to the plan. We then found out that three out of four hypotheses were supported. As committed in the plans, we made the data and the analysis scripts available at [Github](https://github.com/tuomaseerola/cultural_priming). We completed the report, and again the experts checked whether we honoured the commitments made in the preregistration, and after this process was completed, the paper was finally published. My co-author Imre Lahdelma has written [in more detail about the results](https://musicscience.net/2023/01/16/nemur-7-a-day-of-interdisciplinarity-and-collaboration/).

## Registered Report: Is it worth the effort?

As you can see from the description above, publishing a preregistered study takes more effort than a conventional study. This raises the question, is it worth the time and energy? Remember that it took us 19 months to get this project from the pregistration stage to actual publication.
